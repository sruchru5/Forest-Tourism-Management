# Forest-tourism-Management
The Forest Tourism Management System is a comprehensive web-based platform aimed at facilitating the booking process for forest visits by tourists. The system provides tourists with the ability to book tickets for forest visits and reserve facilities such as accommodation and vehicles according to their requirements. Each forest area is managed through the system, with details including the forest ID, location, facility ID, availability, and capacity. Departments are responsible for overseeing specific forest areas, with attributes such as department ID, department name, manager ID, and available slots. Tourists can register and log in to the system using their email and password, allowing them to book tickets and facilities for forest visits. Tourist data, including email, name, contact, and age, are stored in the database. The system facilitates the assignment of tourists to staff members, enabling staff to manage and assist tourists during their visits. Staff members can log in to their accounts to view details of assigned tourists and manage their workload effectively. The website is developed using MySQL for the database and Python IDLE for the web application.
